# Known-Next
---
We'll be taking an MVP app and making it ready for production. Our app is called "Known", a notion / wiki app rip off. Right now its lacking some key features to make it pop and some neccessary ones so we don't lose our jobs ðŸ˜±.

We'll go in and add these features and make the adjustments needed so 20m+ plus users can start using our app. Along, the way, you'll learn what it takes to ship a production grade Next.js app.
